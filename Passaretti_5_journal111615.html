  <p>My 9 rooms will be a metallic lab setting. It will be mostly a maze, and I will
     have absolute position so people will have to scroll sideways to see other doors.
     I want the doorways to be a spinning gear that opens up, and then there will be
     jagged-edge doors that open sideways. The player will have to find the ''key'' and
     find the exit.
