  <h5>Explain basic Webpages</h5>
  <p>A webpage runs off of a single file uploaded to a server. The single 
file is called an html file. The browse(internet-run-thing) will read the 
code on the webpage to make it appear as you see it. A css is another file 
that is attatched to the html. The css is what gives the html color, style, 
and things like that. A class is an identification to give to an element. 
The class can be called in the css to change its color, style, and things 
like that. A div is a divider. It creates a square on the page where you can
fit elements in and style in the css. To put squares on a page, you can put
divs and give them a background color. Giving them a fixed position will make
them immobile. Giving them an absolute position will make them move in 
relation to the entire page. A relative position will make them move in
relation to another element</p>
