  <h1>Journal 11/30</h1>
  <p>My 9 rooms are not finished because i'm stumped at a coding error. I have a single 
     div with several different divs inside it. What I want to happen is mouse over the 
     overarching div and have it trigger all of the animations inside it, rather than
     having one part of the door animate at a time. I was not able to work on it over the
     break because I didn't upload it to my google drive to work at it from home</p>
