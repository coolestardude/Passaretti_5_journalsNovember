  <h3>CSS Animations</h3>

  <p>CSS animations are creative movements that are created in a webpage's CSS file.
      Although they cannot accomplish as much as a Java or Jquery code, they can still
      make a webpage unique. For example, you could make a text or div expand when you
      mouse over it. You could even add something like a loading bar, or have a constant
      looping animation in the background</p>
